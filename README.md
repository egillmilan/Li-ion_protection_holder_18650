# Li-ion protection holder
A protection circuit for a single 18650 lithium-ion cell. The circuit protects the battery from over-voltage (4.225V), under-voltage (3.2V), over-current discharge (~5A) and over-current charging (~5A). The protection thresholds depend on the choice of MOSFETs and the version of the AP9101C protection IC that is being used.

The device also acts as a battery holder for easy integration into various projects. The pin header holes are spaced 2.54mm (0.1") apart which enables the holder to be soldered onto common perforated prototyping boards or it can even be plugged into breadboards.
